# ML Surrogate Model for CO2RR Binding Energies (Template)

This repository is a template for building an end-to-end ML surrogate that
predicts adsorption energies from DFT data. It includes:
- data processing
- feature engineering
- baseline models + PyTorch model
- simple training and inference CLIs
- unit tests
- Dockerfile and environment file

Follow the project plan provided by your assistant to populate the dataset
and extend models / featurization.
